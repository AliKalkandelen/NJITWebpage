  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div>
    <p>I grew up in Istanbul, Turkey. Istanbul is the biggest city in Turkey, therefore i have always been a city boy. My parents owned a clothing manufacturing company in Istanbuls busy business district. 
	They served big clothing names like Aeropostale and Lacoste. If you have ever been to an Aeropostale store before 2004, you have probably seen my parents work. 
	I went to a high class private school in Besiktas and before i could finish middle school i got the news that we are moving to United States. 
	The economy was in rapid decline around that time and we left to find better oppourtunities in the land of the free. My parents, my sister and I rented in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn for 3 years. My dad owned businesses left and right. 
	He got really good in accounting of it all. After months of visiting houses up and down the east coast, we bought a nice house in Secaucus, New Jersey where we currently reside. 
	For the first 2,3 years my dad owned a cartridge filling business in the small shopping area downtown. He closed shop and operates the business from home now. 
	After finishing high school I got my associates in computer science from Hudson County Community College. I got into the deans list 3 semesters in a row. I was also in the computer science club as a database engineer.
	After my associates I transfered over to Rutgers where i dormed for a year. The school told me that
